Hi, I'm Ismael! I'm a sixth-year Physics PhD student at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics)
advised by [Camille Avestruz](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/cavestru.html). I completed by BS in
Physics (2018) and MS in Computer Science (2019) at Stanford University, where I was advised by
[Patricia Burchat](https://profiles.stanford.edu/patricia-burchat). 

This year, I am a [DOE SCGSR](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr) Fellow working with 
[Matthew Becker](https://www.anl.gov/profile/matthew-r-becker) at Argonne National Laboratory.

I am broadly interested in applying statistical methods to data from large cosmological surveys. I
have been an active member of the LSST [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/) 
for most of my PhD.
